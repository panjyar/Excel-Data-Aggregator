##  Overview  
A full-stack **MERN** web application that lets users upload Excel files, aggregates and filters the data, and displays results through an intuitive, real-time React interface.  
It automates repetitive Excel analysis tasks and provides insights instantly.

---

##  Motivation  
Data teams often spend hours manually combining Excel sheets and applying filters.  
This project was built to **simplify Excel-based analysis** by turning it into a one-click web process — making it faster, more reliable, and repeatable.

---

##  Problem It Solves  
- Eliminates repetitive manual aggregation work.  
- Enables users to quickly filter data using multiple fields.  
- Automatically detects and merges duplicate records.  
- Provides a responsive dashboard for data visualization.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  

| Category | Technology |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React.js (Vite), Axios, Styled Components, React Dropzone |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js |
| **Database** | MongoDB Atlas |
| **File Processing** | Multer, XLSX |
| **Deployment** | Render  |

##  Features  
-  **Excel File Import:** Upload `.xlsx` or `.xls` files directly  
-  **Advanced Filtering:** Filter by category, branch, supplier, fabric, and concept  
-  **Smart Aggregation:** Automatically merges identical records and sums quantities  
-  **Real-Time Updates:** Instant display of filtered results  
-  **Responsive UI:** Works smoothly on desktop and mobile  
-  **Summary View:** Displays total counts and quantities  
-  **Error Handling:** Handles invalid files, empty uploads, and bad formats gracefully  

---

##  What I Learned  
- How to parse and process Excel files using **Multer** and **XLSX**.  
- Designing **MongoDB aggregation pipelines** for data grouping and filtering.  
- Building a full-stack data visualization system using **React** and **Express**.  
- Managing asynchronous uploads and real-time state updates.  
- Deploying a complete MERN application on cloud platforms.  

---

##  What Makes It Stand Out  
- Efficient use of MongoDB aggregation pipelines for real-time data summarization.  
- Flexible filtering system that supports multiple selections per field.  
- Clean React-based frontend built with Vite for fast performance.  
- Backend structured for scalability and easy maintenance.
